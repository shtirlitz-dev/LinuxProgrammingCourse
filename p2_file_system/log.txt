about file (command line):
    stat filelname

hard link - adds another name to the data, both names are equivalent (file types)
data removed when the last hardlinked file is removed:
    ln existing hardlinked  => the same inode (see with stat)

soft link refers the file by name, it's a separate file of link type.
if the original file is removed, the link is broken. if a new file is created 
with the same name, the soft link file refers the new one
    ln -s existing softlinked  => ll shows softlinked -> existing
