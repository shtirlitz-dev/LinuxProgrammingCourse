# ICP

- files
- signals
- pipes (named, anonymous)
- message queues (mq_open, mq_send, ...)
- shared memory
- sockets
- posix-semafores
- rpc (man rps)
- ipc (system v)

# pipes:

a pipe creates 2 file descriptors, only 1 direction
fork makes a child
parent closes read end, child closes write end

parent ---> pipe ---> child

function pipe (man 2 pipe - has an example)

popen - enables to read output from commands that are usually used from console


named pipes:
mkfifo (man 3)


# signals

every process has signal handlers (e.g. Ctrl+C)
signal has just a number
some handlers can be overriden, some cannot (e.g. signal 9)

<signal.h>

SIGINT - 2 to terminate
SIGABRT - 6 = abort (man 3)
SIGTERM - 15 = can you terminate
SIGKILL - 9 = kill 
SIGCHLD - 17 = termination of a child (see function wait...)
SIFUSR = user signals

daemons define set of signals

send a signal: function kill (man 2) or utility kill (man 1)
	kill -l => list
	
kill(pid,signum) - send
signal(signum, sighandler_t) - set handler, returns old handler
SIGSTOP, SIGKILL cannot be set


# address space

upper addresses FFFFFFFF... and down
core
stack

shared memory (shared libraries and shared memory)

heap
data
code


function:
shmget - create or get a memory region
shmat - attach to a region
shmdt - detach
shmctl - control

shmget - mem size rounded to page size

utility ipcs shows shared memory segments and other IPC things.
	ipcs -m = only memory
	
# multiplexing

we have files with descriptors 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout), 2 (stderr) and other that we opened using fd = open(...)
set of file descriptors: every fd is projected to a bit

df_set watch_list;  // fd_set is type with bits projected to descriptors

macros:

FD_ZERO(&watch_list); // zero all
FD_SET(fd, &watch_list); // set bit for file descriptor
FD_CLR(fd, &watch_list); // reset bit for file descriptor

int select(count, fd_set_read, fd_set_write, fd_set_except, timeout)
returns number of ready files
to know who is ready: FD_ISSET(fd, &watch_list);

command line for creatin named pipe:
mkfifo f1.fifo => creates a pipe which can be opened with int fd = open("f1.fifo", O_RDONLY)
